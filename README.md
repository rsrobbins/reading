=======

A simple web application for managing a list of books I have read.
This project is mainly intended to help me to learn how to use GitHub and git. 
This web application is built using the web.py framework. To get started, get the latest development version from git:
git clone git://github.com/webpy/webpy.git
Copy the web folder into your reading folder.

This web application is based on the simple blog example code. I will be working on this project to learn how to expand on the sample code to construct a more complete web application. The web application itself serves almost no purpose but the project will be a gradual discovery of how to use the web.py framework.
